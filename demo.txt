Explanation (If needed at Demo):
The printPuzzle function is just using the pointer notation to access each row, col element in arr and print it.
For the searchPuzzle function, we created 3 helper functions, which are isSameChar, searchWord, and markPath.
isSameChar is to make the code case insensitive AND to compare two letters (a letter from the puzzle grid compared
with a letter from the user's word). searchWord is to search for the word recursively, and markPath is to mark the
path in the result matrix.
For the isSameChar function, we pass char a and char b, and convert them to the uppercase
characters by subtracting 32 as lowercase characters are always 32 higher than uppercase characters in ASCII. It
returns 1 if characters match, otherwise 0.
For the markPath function, 
For the searchWord function, 
For the searchPuzzle function, we first defined the word length, and declared 2D-integer array searchPath to print
numbers at the end.
